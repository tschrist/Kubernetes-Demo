Kubernetes (K8s) Demo for SDI Demo POD

The public site in GKE with Purley servers: https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=k8s-hybrid-cloud-demo
You may want to add your gmail account for access outside the federated firewall – that’s how we showed the dashboard offsite.

Here are the repos for the K8s demo:
https://github.com/elsonrodriguez/k8s-usb - initial setup for master and nodes
https://github.com/elsonrodriguez/federation-setup (private:contact elsonrodriguez to add you) to setup federation between local, AWS, GKE
https://github.com/elsonrodriguez/booth-demos - this has the dotproduct demo
